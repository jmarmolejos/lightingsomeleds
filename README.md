lightingsomeleds
================

Some very simple code to play around with three leds using nodejs and johnny-five to interact with the arduino board. It's basically an http request that lights up one of the colored leds depending on the request status and result.

The checkPage function is injected into the repl so it can be run from the terminal to test a different page once the code is running.
